## Project title 
News Media Web site

## Description 
Web technologies brought a big change in human lifestyle. There are millions of news resources posted on the web every second. But it is hard to get news by systematic ways. 
	In WAP course, we learnt many useful technologies for web technologies. So we wanted to create simple but very systematic news media web page as a final project. 

## Use cases
There are 2 parts in the web site. Admin portal and client site.
Admin portal has a login page, so publishers need to be login in order to publish news.
Users can write comments without login.

News divided into some categories, so users can see news by its specific category.
User can easily find the news related others reaction point on it.
